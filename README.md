# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

In this writing I shared what is dimensionality reduction, why is it important to understand, and how to do the dimensionality reduction. Few dimensionality reduction techniques used in this writing are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). All techniques showed in `Python`, so it is important to have a basic knowledge of `Python` as programming language. 


It is currently been shared in `.ipynb` format and written in Bahasa. If you need it in other language, feel free to translate or contact me instead. Cheers!
